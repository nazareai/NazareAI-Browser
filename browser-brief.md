## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Base**: Chromium engine or Electron framework
- **Languages**: TypeScript, Rust (for performance-critical components)
- **AI Integration**: Direct API calls, WebAssembly for local models
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for local data, encrypted keychain for credentials

### Architecture Principles
- Modular, plugin-based design
- Clear separation of browser engine and AI features
- Asynchronous, non-blocking AI operations
- Graceful degradation when AI services unavailable

### Platform Support
- Windows 10/11
- macOS 12+
- Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch)
- ARM support for Apple Silicon

## Implementation Priority Guide

### Core Foundation
Start with these fundamental components that other features depend on:
- Browser window with tabs and navigation
- search.sh as default search engine
- Basic settings/preferences system
- API key storage and management system

### Feature Implementation Order (Flexible)
Implement in any order based on your needs:

**Quick Wins** (Can implement immediately):
- Command palette (Cmd+K)
- Chat with current webpage
- Basic sidebar with pinned tabs
- Theme switching (light/dark)

**Medium Complexity**:
- YouTube video summarization
- PDF analysis
- Tab groups and workspaces
- Split view functionality
- MCP server connections

**Advanced Features**:
- Local LLM integration
- Advanced MCP ecosystem
- Custom themes engine
- Performance optimizations
- Developer tools enhancements

## Success Metrics
- Page load performance on par with Chrome/Firefox
